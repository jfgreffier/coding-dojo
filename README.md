Kata, randories and stuff

## How to run?

You have different possibilities to run the tests and practice katas with this repo:
1. Simply open the project on [Stackblitz](https://stackblitz.com/fork/github/jfgreffier/coding-dojo?title=Coding%20Dojo). No account required.
2. [GitHub codespace](https://codespaces.new/jfgreffier/coding-dojo), if you have a GitHub account.
3. You can also run the project locally. You'll need to install dependencies with `npm ci`, then run the tests with `npm test`.

## Kata ideas

### Fizz Buzz

https://kata-log.rocks/fizz-buzz-kata

- Write a function that returns a number passed as argument
- For multiples of three return `Fizz` instead of the number
- For the multiples of five return `Buzz` instead of the number
- For numbers which are multiples of both three and five return `FizzBuzz` instead of the number

### Roman numerals

https://kata-log.rocks/roman-numerals-kata

Write a function that takes a number and converts it to the according string representation.
